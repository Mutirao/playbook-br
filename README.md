### Testando código localmente

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need to install Jekyll and other dependencies:

If you don't already have Ruby and Bundler installed, follow [the first two steps in these Jekyll installation instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#installing-jekyll "Installation instructions for Jekyll").

Next, [fork this repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ "Instructions for Forking Your Repository") and clone it on your computer.

Navigate to the folder on your computer, and run the command `$ bundle install` at the command line prompt.

To run the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to preview the site.
