title: Entenda o que os usuários realmente precisam
---

Projetos digitais devem ser iniciados com a exploração e identificação das necessidades das pessoas que vão usar o serviço, compreendendo como ele se encaixa no cotidiano delas. São estas necessidades – e não as limitações da estrutura governamental – que precisam guiar as decisões técnicas, de design e conteúdo. Da mesma forma, é importante manter uma dinâmica de testes contínuos dos produtos para garantir a coerência sobre o que é importante.

#### checklist
1. Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
3. Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
4. Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
5. Share findings with the team and agency leadership
6. Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
7. As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs

#### key questions
- What user needs will this service address?

- Who are your key users?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
- What research methods were used?
