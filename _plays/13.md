Quando há colaboração na abertura e publicação dos dados públicos podemos melhorar o Governo juntos. Se criamos serviços mais abertamente e publicamos dados abertos, nós simplificamos o acesso público aos serviços e informações do governo, permitindo que o público facilmente ofereça ajustes e contribuições, além de permitir a reutilização por empreendedores, organizações sem fins lucrativos, outros prestadores de serviço e o público.

#### checklist
1. Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
2. Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)
3. Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
4. Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing
5. Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in such a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public
6. Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in such a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost
7. When appropriate, create an API for third parties to interact with the service directly
8. When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online
9. When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly

#### key questions
- How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?
- If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Who uses it? How is it documented?
- If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.
- What components are made available to the public as open source?
- What datasets are made available to the public?
