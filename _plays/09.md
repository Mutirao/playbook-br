title: Publique em um ambiente de hospedagem flexível
---

Os serviços devem ser implementados em uma infraestrutura flexível, onde recursos devem ser providos em tempo real para atender picos de demanda dos usuários. Os serviços digitais se mostram deficientes quando os hospedados em centros de dados que se vendem como “hospedagem em nuvem”, mas que requerem gerenciamento de hardware direto. Esta prática obsoleta desperdiça tempo, enfraquece os planos de recuperação de desastres e resultam em custos significativamente maiores.

#### checklist
1. Resources are provisioned on demand
2. Resources scale based on real-time user demand
3. Resources are provisioned through an API
4. Resources are available in multiple regions
5. We pay only for the resources we use
6. Static assets are served through a content delivery network
7. Application is hosted on commodity hardware

#### key questions
-	Where is your service hosted?
-	What hardware does your service use to run?
-	What is the demand / usage pattern for your service?
-	What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?
-	How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?
-	How long does it take you to provision a new resource such as an application server?
-	How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?
-	How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure — i.e., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed?
-	Is your service hosted in multiple regions / availability zones / data centers?
-	In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?
-	What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?
-	What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?
-	How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?
